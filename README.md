## Do the basic npm install jamboree
## npm run dev for dev

## create and add desired port to .env file

## Client
Run client with `npm run client -- <host|client> <port>`.

To test the chatting, use two terminals:
First `npm run client -- host <port number>` in one terminal,  
then `npm run client -- client <port number>` in other. Port number has to be same for both. Then just start typing messages :)
